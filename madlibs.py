madlib=f"A {noun1} in {state1} was arrested in the {time1} after he {verb1}\
a in front of {noun2}.{name}, had a history of {verb2}, but no one not \
even his {noun3} ever imagined he'd {verb3} with a {noun4} stuck in his\
{bodypart}i always thought he was{adjective1}, but i never thougth he'd do something like this\
said his {relative}.\
after a brief {activity}, cops followed him to {resturant}, where he reportdly\
{adjpasttense} in the fry machine\
in {month}, a women was also charged with a similar crime, but rather than {verb4}\
with a {noun5}, she {verbpasttense} with a {adjective2} dog.\
either way, we imagine that after witnessing him {verb6} with a {blank} there \
are probably a whole lot of {pluralnoun} thart are going to need therapy."
